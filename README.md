AS A foodie,
I WANT TO keep track of food I would like to eat and have eaten,
SO THAT I can know what to try next

This site uses Handlebars, MySQL, and a homemade ORM to create a burger logger to keep track of what burgers you'd like to eat and which of those you have eaten.

Usage: Enter a burger you'd like to eat in the from and submit it.
List of burgers you'd like to eat will be on the left, and those you've eaten will be on the right.
Click on a burger on the left to transfer it to the right, signifying that you have now eaten it.

Installation:
For a local repo:
    Clone Repo,
    "npm install" from inside the directory to install all necessary node modules
    Set up mySQL Workbench to create and use a database called "burgers_db", and alter connection file user and password to fit your username and password
    run "npm start" or "node server"
